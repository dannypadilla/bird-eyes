# BIRDEEZ

## desc:
   * easy:
     * detect birds
   * hard:
     * classify hood birds breeds


## ToDo:
   1. PREP:
      * convert videos to smaller format (to share with repo since they're huge files)
   2. create jupyter notebook for preprocessing
   3. convert videos to images for testing (full res?)
   4. tbd


#### notes:
  * preprocess videos to filter out background
  * after background subtraction should show only birds
    * https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html
  * convert bird images for training
  * classify... done!


## equipment:
   * gopro for videos (848 x 480 @ 60 fps)
